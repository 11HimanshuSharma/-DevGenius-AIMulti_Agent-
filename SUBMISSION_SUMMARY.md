### 🛠️ **Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks** ✅
**File**: [TECHNOLOGY_STACK.md](TECHNOLOGY_STACK.md)

**Agent Frameworks**:
- **LangGraph**: Multi-agent workflow orchestration (PRIMARY)
- **LangChain**: LLM integration and agent foundation
- **Alternative Evaluation**: CrewAI, AutoGen (with justification for LangGraph selection)

**Communication Protocols**:
- State-based message passing
- LangGraph conditional routing
- Structured data validation with Pydantic

**Orchestration Tools**:
- LangGraph StateGraph for workflow management
- Conditional edges for dynamic routing
- Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms

**Supporting Technologies**:
- Streamlit for web interface
- pytest for test execution
- python-dotenv for configuration
- Azure OpenAI for LLM services

### 🧠 **LLM Selection** ✅
**File**: [LLM_ANALYSIS.md](LLM_ANALYSIS.md)

**Best LLM Choice: GPT-4 / GPT-4 Turbo**
- **Justification**: Superior code generation, advanced reasoning, consistency
- **Technical Specs**: 8K-128K context, deterministic outputs, enterprise reliability
- **Use Case Fit**: Perfect for complex multi-step development workflows

**Free-Tier Options**:

1. **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo** (Recommended)
   - Cost: $0.002/1K tokens
   - Quality: 70-80% of GPT-4 performance
   - Use Case: Development, testing, education

2. **Google Gemini Pro**
   - Cost: Generous free tier
   - Quality: Competitive code generation
   - Use Case: Public demos, experimentation

3. **Open Source Models** (Hugging Face)
   - Options: Code Llama, StarCoder, Mistral
   - Cost: Completely free (infrastructure required)
   - Use Case: Research, privacy-sensitive deployments

**Selection Justification**:
- Application needs: Multi-domain expertise, complex reasoning, consistency
- Performance requirements: Professional-quality code generation
- Integration needs: Mature API, LangChain compatibility
- Cost-benefit analysis: Value justifies premium model for production
