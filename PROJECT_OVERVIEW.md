# 🚀 DevGenius: Your Automated AI Software Development Team

DevGenius is a small web app that acts like an **automated software development
team**.  
You give it a feature request (like _"create a calculator function"_), and a
team of AI agents work together to **write, test, review, and fix the code until
it’s ready**.

It’s designed to **eliminate the slow, back-and-forth process of coding** and
automate the entire development loop.

## ❌ The Problem: Coding Can Be a Slow Grind

Writing code isn’t just about typing. Most of the time is spent in a repetitive
feedback cycle:

1. A developer writes some code
2. A reviewer checks it and gives feedback
3. A tester runs it to see if it breaks
4. If there are issues, it goes back to the developer to be fixed

This loop is **essential for quality**, but also a **major bottleneck**.  
**DevGenius tackles this head-on.**

## ✅ The Solution: An AI Team That Works for You

DevGenius uses a team of specialized **AI agents** that mimic a real-world dev
team.  
The entire process is **automated in a continuous loop**:

- 🤵 **Project Manager** → Turns your simple request into a detailed coding task
- 👨‍💻 **Coder** → Writes the first draft of the Python code
- 🧐 **Reviewer** → Reviews the code for bugs, style issues, and potential
  problems
- 🧪 **Tester** → Writes and runs `pytest` tests to check correctness and edge
  cases
- 🛠️ **Fixer (Refactor Agent)** → Fixes issues found by the Reviewer or Tester
  and improves the code

If issues are found, the code is **sent back through the loop** until it’s fixed
(or a maximum number of tries is reached).
